/**
 * The context object which schedules and executes image loading requests.
 *
 * This is the main object you interact with to fetch images. Usually
 * this is done via the class method itself. A simple example would be
 *
 *     Matisse.load(imageURL).into(myImageView)
 *
 * The Matisse class itself actually only provides the means to execute an
 * ImageRequest. DSL related methods can be found on `ImageRequestBuilder`.
 *
 * Caching in Matisse is done on two levels: fast and slow.
 *
 * The fast cache is read/written directly on the main thread and therefore
 * must retrieve and store images fast (as the name indicates). This is
 * usually implemented using some kind of in-memory cache (like `NSCache`).
 * The default Matisse instance uses the `MemoryImageCache` for this if not
 * explicitely configured.
 *
 * The second level is the slow cache. This cache will only be accessed
 * from the syncQueue which should be the background. The slow cache may take
 * more time to retrieve cache images, often involving file IO. The default
 * Matisse instance uses the `DiskImageCache` if not explicitely configured.

     * Create a custom instance of Matisse.
     *
     * If for some reason you need a second Matisse instance you can create
     * one yourself. You need to specify the fast cache, the slow cache and
     * the image request handler. Optionally you can also pass a queue to be
     * used as the synchronization queue, though this is mostly intended for
     * testing purposes.
     * 
     * If you pass `nil` for either of the caches, caching at that level is
     * disabled.
     *
     * You should not have to use this very often, instead you would configure
     * the shared Matisse instance using e.g. `Matisse.useFastCache(myCache)`
     * at the beginning of your program.
     *
     * - Parameters:
     *   - fastCache:      The cache to use on the main thread. Pass `nil` to disable.
     *   - slowCache:      The cache that is used from the background. Pass `nil` to disable.
     *   - requestHandler: The ImageRequestHandler that is used to resolve
     *                     requests that were not cached.
     *   - syncQueue:      The queue used to synchronize requests. MUST be a
     *                     serial queue, and SHOULD be in the background. There
     *                     is usually no need to change this, and it's provided
     *                     only for testing.
     *
     * - Returns:
     *   A custom Matisse instance.

     * Executes the given image request and returns the result asynchronously.

     * This method first tries to fetch the image from the `fastCache`,
     * directly on the main thread. If this fails, the `slowCache` is tried on
     * the background in turn. If this cache too has no image, then the
     * `requestHandler` is called to fetch and prepare the request. The result
     * is stored in the caches if successful and delivered via the passed

     * The completion block is always called asynchronous on the main thread.
     * If the request can be resolved via the fast cache, then the image is
     * also returned from the method, allowing you to act on it without delay.
     *
     * - Note:
     *   This method must be called from the main thread.

     *   If the request could be resolved using the fast cache, this returns the
     *   resolved image. Otherwise `nil` is returned.
