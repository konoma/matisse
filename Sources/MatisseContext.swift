/// The context object that schedules and executes image loading requests.
///
/// This is the central class coordinating image loading, creating and caching.
/// It also takes care of request coalescing, so that multiple requests for the same
/// image only need to do the download and creation once.
///
///
/// ## Caching
///
/// Caching in Matisse is done on two levels: fast and slow.
///
/// The fast cache is read/written directly on the main thread and therefore
/// must retrieve and store images fast (as the name indicates). This is
/// usually implemented using some kind of in-memory cache (like `NSCache`).
/// The default Matisse instance uses the `MemoryImageCache` for this if not
/// explicitely configured.
///
/// The second level is the slow cache. This cache will only be accessed from the sync
/// queue which is in the background. The slow cache may take more time to retrieve
/// cache images, and will often involve file IO. The default Matisse instance uses the
/// `DiskImageCache` for this if not explicitely configured.
///
/// You provide the fast and slow cache in the initializer as classes implementing
/// `ImageCache`. You may disable one or both chaches by passing `nil` instead of
/// a cache object.
///
///
/// ## Request Handling
///
/// When an image request is submitted, the context first tries to find a matching
/// image in the slow cache, and if this fails the fast cache. If that fails, it
/// tries to find a currently executed request that is equivalent to the submitted
/// request. If such a request is found then the result of the running request will
/// be used for this request too. In case no such request can be found then the
/// contexts `ImageRequestHandler` is asked to fullfill the image request. The result
/// is then cached if possible and returned for all equivalent requests.
///
/// If you want to customize downloading or image creation behavior, pass a custom
/// `ImageRequestHandler` instance when creating the context.
///

    /// Executes the given `ImageRequest` and returns the result asynchronously.
    ///
    /// First the request is attempted to resolve using the fast cache on the main
    /// thread. If an image is found, it's returned from this method and the completion
    /// Block is called asynchronously. If this cache misses or no fast cache is set,
    /// `nil` is returned and the request will be tried to resolve in the background.
    ///
    /// First in the background, the slow cache is checked for a match. If successful,
    /// the completion block is called with the result. If that fails too, the request
    /// is passed to a queue that manages equivalent requests such that the work of
    /// downloading and creating the image only needs to be done once. If no equivalent
    /// request is already being resolved, then this request is resovled using the
    /// `ImageRequestHandler`. The result of this operation is reported using the
    /// completion block.
    ///
    /// - Note:
    ///   This method must be called from the main thread
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - request:    The image request to resolve.
    ///   - completion: The completion handler that will be called with the result. This
    ///                 block is always called asynchronously, even if the request was
    ///                 resolved using the fast cache.
    ///
    /// - Returns:
    ///   If the request could be resolved using the fast cache, this returns the resolved
    ///   image. Otherwise `nil` is returned.
