/// This class provides a fluid interface to configure an image request.
///
/// You cannot create instances of this class yourself. Instead use the `Matisse.load(_:)`
/// method on to retrieve a `SwiftImageRequestCreator`.
///
/// Then configure the request using the methods on the creator.
///
///     Matisse.load(exampleURL).resizeTo(width: 100.0, height: 100.0)
///
/// Finally execute the request with `fetch(_:)` or another execution method.
///
///     Matisse.load(exampleURL).resizeTo(width: 100.0, height: 100.0).showIn(imageView)
///
/// If you create custom image transformations, you should add an extension to this
/// creator. Make sure you return the creator instance so that a fluid call chain can
/// be maintained.
